# timetrack backend

Is a spring-boot REST-API that handles time tracking data.

## Run it
In order to run we need at least a mongodb. Follow [Run it](../README.md) from the parent project,
then run the application in `dev` profile.

Also checkout [elasticsearch](../docker/containers/elasticsearch/README.md) and [kibana](../docker/containers/kibana/README.md).
